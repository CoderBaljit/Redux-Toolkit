📝 A Simple Todo App with Redux Toolkit
You might be thinking, "It’s just a basic Todo app..." — but don’t underestimate the power of small projects! 🚀

While building this app, I gained hands-on experience with React Redux Toolkit, especially in the following areas:

🧠 State management: Learned how to manage state more efficiently using Redux Toolkit.

⚙️ App optimization: Understood how to optimize performance by structuring state properly.

🛠️ Practical implementation: Got comfortable with slices, reducers, and actions in real-world scenarios.

This project may be small, but the impact on my knowledge was huge. It taught me that even simple projects can offer deep insights and help solidify important concepts. 📚

If you think small projects are a waste of time — think again! 💡 Even a Todo app can be a playground for exploring more complex ideas.
